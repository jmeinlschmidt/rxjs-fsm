> :warning: This package is not yet released!

This package provides a set of tools for utilizing complete deterministic finite automata (Finite state machine) in RxJS with a focus on functional programming.
Allowing developers to efficiently manage complex state machines in context of reactive programming.

✅ &nbsp;Tree Shakeable (ES modules)  
✅ &nbsp;Fully Typed  
✅ &nbsp;Unit Tests  
‼️ &nbsp;Documentation (WIP)
